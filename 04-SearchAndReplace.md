# Search and Replace (no Vim conflicts, one unclear aspect)

* Find, Ctrl+ F
* Replace, Ctrl+ H
* Find next/prev, F3 / Shift+ F3 
* Select all occurences of find match, Alt+ Enter
    * This begins multiple cursors
    * Vim: enter insert mode first
* Add selection to next find match, Ctrl+ D (!clear)
* Move last selection to next find match, Ctrl+ K Ctrl+ D (!clear)
* Toggle case-sensitive / regex / whole word, Alt+ C / R / W

## Notes

* It is not clear what it means to "add selection to next find match"
